# The Kessel Run
`Traverse a galaxy far, far, away...`

This is a traversable model of the galaxy based on the Star Wars themed API: SWAPI. The user can travel around to and view the many locations featured in the Star Wars galaxy. A picture of and brief details on each location will be displayed. Their current location is persisted so that they can always resume their journey across the stars.
